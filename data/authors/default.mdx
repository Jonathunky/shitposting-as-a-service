### soul in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª, body in ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, glory to ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦!

THIS is 1995 Jonathunky and today, Iâ€™m going to show you all of his quirks and features:

Nuclear & wild person with positive vibes and incredible proficiency in computer systems

Who passionately loves & enjoys:

* Formula 1 Racing
* Competitive Tetris
* Moosic â€” drum and bass, dub, modern indie rock & pop, and so much more!
* Rose-coloured things + flashy looks
* Healthy lifestyle
* \* this place is vacant for a single person, haha *

And fully support urbanism, micromobility, and right to repair movement

Also doesn't really like capitalism and patriarchy, but we'll deal with them later, shall we?
